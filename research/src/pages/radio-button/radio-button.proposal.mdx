## Overview

The `<oui-radio-button>` element is a control that allows the user to select a single choice out of a set of choices. It has a binary "checked" state, either checked or unchecked (where "checked" is the selected choice, while all the other remain "unchecked".

Because the `<oui-radio-button>` is a choice from a set of choices, the choices are logically grouped by an implicit or explicit `<oui-radio-button-group>`. This proposal will deal with the existence of both elements, the different ways they can interact and their properties.

### Use Cases

The `<oui-radio-button-group>` is used in cases very similar to a `<select>` element, where the user is presented with a set of options from which they can select a single one.

Differently from `<select>`, where all the `<option>` are condensed into a single box, the `<oui-radio-button-group>` has all the `<oui-radio-button>` visible, readily available to be read and selected. Choosing between a `<select>` and `<oui-radio-button-group>` is a matter of layout and information density preference, in most cases.

Also differently from a `<select>`, there is currently no `multiple` attribute to allow a multiple choice group, and this document will not propose one for now.

## Radio Button Design

This section relates to a single `<oui-radio-button>`. Because it cannot stand on its own, without being part of and either explicit or implicit `<oui-radio-button-group>`, it does not have attributes such `required` or `readonly`, those being attributes of the group. A single `required` option is a group makes the other choices pointless, while a `readonly` option makes itself pointles.

The radio button has, however a `disabled` attribute, meaning it's a possible choice, but that is currently unavailable.

If used inside a `<oui-radio-button-group>`, it gets implicitly bound to the group, becoming one of the choices. If declared outside of it, it should contain a `group` attribute equal to the group's `name` attribute.

| `defaultChecked` | `bool`   | `false`       | The initial value for `checked`. Defaults to false.                                                    |
| `value`          | `string` | `null`        | The value of the radio button (this is the value of a single possible choice).                         |
| `autofocus`      | `bool`   | `false`       | Get focus by default.                                                                                  |

| `group`          | `string` | `null`        | Binds the button to a radio button group. While inside a radio button group, it is implicitly defined. |

#### DOM Structure (Implicit Grouping)

The following structure represents a group with the `choices` slot filled with radio buttons (their internal structures are omitted for brevity).

```html
<oui-radio-button-group name="group-name">
  <slot name="label">
    <label part="label"></label>
  </slot>
  <slot name="required-indicator">
    <div part="required-indicator"></div>
  </slot>
  <slot name="choices">
    <div part="choices">
      <oui-radio-button />
      <oui-radio-button />
      <oui-radio-button />
      ...
    </div>
  </slot>
</oui-radio-button-group>
```

#### DOM Structure (Explicit Grouping)

The following structure, in contrast, represents a group with an empty `choices` slot. The choices are placed outside the group, providing layout flexibility. Each choice has a `group` attribute with value equal to the radio button group's name, making them explicitly bound as choices of that group.

There is also the possibility of having both implicit and explicit choices.

```html
<oui-radio-button-group name="group-name">
  <slot name="label">
    <label part="label"></label>
  </slot>
  <slot name="required-indicator">
    <div part="required-indicator"></div>
  </slot>
  <slot name="choices">
    <div part="choices">
      ... (it could also be populated)
    </div>
  </slot>
</oui-radio-button-group>

<oui-radio-button group="group-name" />
<oui-radio-button group="group-name" />
<oui-radio-button group="group-name" />
```
