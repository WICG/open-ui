# Light dismiss

## Overview

"Light dismiss" describes the behavior of a component that dismisses
itself automatically when a user performs an action that implies that they are
finished interacting with the component. Such actions include clicking outside
of its bounds or pressing the escape key. "Dismissal" generally means that the
component becomes hidden.

Examples of components that often use light dismiss include a listbox input's
dropdown, a date input with a calendar flyout, and many non-modal popup dialogs.

## Light dismiss triggers

The actions that trigger light dismiss are:

- The user presses the escape key.
- A focus change occurs (because of either user interaction or script), where
  the focus target is outside of the contents of the component. This includes
  the case where the user invokes a non-focusable element, which causes focus to
  jump to the nearest focusable ancestor of that element.
- An OS-level focus change occurs such that the window containing the
  component no longer has focus. For example, the user switches to a different
  browser tab or switches to a different application.

For a <a href="/contribute#composite-component">composite component</a>, light
dismiss can apply to some sub-parts of the component but not others. For
example, a <a href="/components/select">select</a>'s listbox dropdown has light
dismiss but its button does not.

<p class="note">
  If a component (or part of a component) has light dismiss and it can contain non-focusable
  content, then the top level element of the component or part with light dismiss should be made
  focusable (e.g. with `tabindex="-1"`). Otherwise, if a user invokes any of the non-focusable
  content in the component, then focus will move outside of the part to the nearest focusable
  ancestor, triggering light dismiss when it probably isn't what the user expected.
